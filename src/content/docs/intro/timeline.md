  - a simple WebSocket data-transfer server written in Python
  - Web interface written with React 
- First design of the Power Management System
  - battery connect to a main switch, controlling power to two motors and a transformer to power the Jetson Nano
- First prototype
  - hull built with two PVC tubes, connected by 3D-printed parts
- First launching test
  - the control system work oppositely ðŸ¤£
  - motors got stuck in the aquatic plants
